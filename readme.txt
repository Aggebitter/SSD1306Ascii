SSD1306Ascii is an Arduino character only library
for small OLED displays like the Adafruit 1.3" and 0.96" 
Monochrome displays.

Many low cost OLED displays with SSD1306 controllers are 
available on ebay. 

The SSD1306Ascii library is unbuffered and only requires a few
bytes of RAM.

Here is memory use for the SPI "Hello world!" example:

Sketch uses 2,582 bytes (8%) of program storage space. Maximum
is 32,256 bytes.

Global variables use 52 bytes (2%) of dynamic memory, leaving
1,996 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2,048 bytes.


This library is in early development so the API and features may
change. The library is likely to have bugs and be unstable. The
purpose for this release is to get feedback for future development.

See the html documentation for more information.

This is a total rewrite of an earlier version of this library.
